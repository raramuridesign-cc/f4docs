## What it is

Fabrik is an open source Joomla! application builder that allows you to collect information from users through forms, send it to a MySQL database table, and then be able to present viewers with this information in various ways including:

Lists - which display a list of all your records submitted through a particular form.
Visualizations - which take data from your database and visualize this through charts, maps, calendars and more.

With Fabrik you can create applications that range in complexity from simple contact forms to a job application site or bug tracking system.

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.
