# How can you help

## Overview

This project relies entirely on community support, we have listed below ways in which you can assist.

## Contribute code

The development team is the most important aspect to the project, and the time and effort that has been put in is really valuable. Assisting with code improvements is a great way to move the project to a different level. 

### How to start

## Bug hunting and testing

This is one the most valuable tasks you can contribute you time to.
