# Introduction

## Overview

Fabrik is an open source Joomla! application builder that allows you to collect information from users through forms, send it to a MySQL database table, and then be able to present viewers with this information in various ways including:

- Lists - which display a list of all your records submitted through a particular form.
- Visualizations - which take data from your database and visualize this through charts, maps, calendars and more.

With Fabrik you can create applications that range in complexity from simple contact forms to a job application site or bug tracking system.

## How easy is it to create a Fabrik Application

Fabrik has a broad set of functions, both basic and advanced, and with these it is possible to create a broad range of applications.

If you are non-technical and only want a simple application to store and list data, then you can create this purely from the Fabrik administrator interface without writing any PHP or Javascript code.

If you are reasonably technical, and prepared to spend the time learning about Fabrik (from the wiki and other resources on this site) and to write some small pieces of PHP and / or Javascript, you can create sophisticated applications and visualizations. To get prompt support to help you along the learning curve and to get any issues to come across looked at more quickly, a Professional subscription to Fabrikar is recommended.

However, Fabrik cannot possibly provide all the functionality that is potentially possible with PHP, Javascript and MySQL, so there will be some applications which are just not possible to build using Fabrik. If you are thinking about a using Fabrik for creating a complex application, it is important to think ahead about the design of your database, lists, forms, etc. and to reduce the risk of starting your development and then finding that Fabrik is unsuitable, the Fabrikar consulting team can review your design.
